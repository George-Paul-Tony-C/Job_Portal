Of course. Let's move beyond a simple feature list and architect a truly professional, industrial-grade product lifecycle. This detailed 12-phase plan is designed to showcase deep product ownership, advanced technical skills, and a forward-thinking approach to building scalable, secure, and user-centric applications.

We will build this systemically, ensuring each phase builds upon a well-tested and robust foundation.

---

### **Phase 0: Foundation & Architectural Blueprint**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To establish a rock-solid, scalable foundation and make key architectural decisions before writing a single line of feature code. This is the most critical phase for long-term success.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** An industrial-grade application isn't built on ad-hoc decisions. This phase is about creating our project's "constitution"‚Äîa set of rules, patterns, and tools that will govern all future development, ensuring consistency, quality, and maintainability. We are investing time now to save months of refactoring later.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Project & Monorepo Setup:** Initialize the project directories and `npm` packages for both `backend` and `frontend`.
    2.  **Architectural Pattern:** Formally adopt our enhanced **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** structure. Create the entire directory tree (`api`, `config`, `models`, `services`, etc.) to establish the blueprint.
    3.  **Environment Configuration:** Create a `.env.example` file listing all required environment variables (`PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `POLYGON_RPC_URL`, `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS`, `EMAIL_HOST`, etc.). This is crucial for onboarding new developers and for deployment.
    4.  **Database & Logging:** Implement the Mongoose connection logic in `config/db.js` with retry mechanisms. Set up the **Winston** logger (`utils/logger.js`) with different transports for development (colorized console) and production (structured JSON file logs).
    5.  **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Configure a basic Continuous Integration pipeline using **GitHub Actions**. The initial workflow will, on every push to a development branch, automatically install dependencies and run a linter (**ESLint**) and code formatter (**Prettier**) to enforce a consistent code style across the entire project.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Project & Tooling Setup:** Initialize the React project using **Vite** for its speed. Install all primary dependencies: `axios` for data fetching, `react-router-dom` for navigation, `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` for state management, and `tailwindcss`.
    2.  **Design System & Theming:** Before building components, define the application's visual identity. In `tailwind.config.js`, extend the default theme with custom brand colors, fonts, and spacing. In `styles/themes.js`, create the explicit color palettes for the `light` and `dark` themes.
    3.  **Component Architecture:** Formally adopt the **Atomic Design** methodology. Create the `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms` directories inside `components/` and create placeholder files for a few core elements like `Button.jsx` (atom) and `SearchBar.jsx` (molecule) to set the pattern.
    4.  **Centralized API Client:** Configure a master Axios instance in `api/apiClient.js`. Set up **interceptors** to:
        * Automatically attach the JWT `Authorization` header to all outgoing requests.
        * Automatically handle 401 Unauthorized errors by logging the user out and redirecting to the login page.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The backend server runs and successfully connects to the MongoDB database. The frontend application renders a basic layout with a header and footer. The GitHub repository is set up with a CI pipeline that passes on linting and formatting checks.

---

### **Phase 1: Identity & Authentication Core**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To build a secure, production-grade authentication system that is resilient to common threats and provides a seamless user experience.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** User identity is the most critical piece of a professional network. Our authentication system must not only be secure but also convenient. We will implement a refresh token strategy to keep users logged in for extended periods without compromising the security of short-lived access tokens.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Schema & Hashing:** Implement the `user.model.js` with a `role` field (defaulting to `'user'`). Use `bcryptjs` with a robust salt round (e.g., 12) for password hashing.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Use **Zod** to create strict schemas in `validations/auth.validation.js` for registration and login payloads. The `validation.middleware.js` will use these schemas to reject any invalid request before it hits the controller.
    3.  **JWT & Refresh Token Strategy:**
        * Upon login, generate a short-lived **Access Token** (e.g., 15 minutes) and a long-lived **Refresh Token** (e.g., 7 days).
        * The Access Token is sent in the JSON response.
        * The Refresh Token is sent as an **HTTPOnly, Secure cookie**, making it inaccessible to client-side JavaScript and protecting it from XSS attacks.
    4.  **Security Hardening:** In `config/security.js`, implement **Helmet** to set crucial security headers and **express-rate-limit** on the login and register routes to prevent brute-force attacks.
    5.  **Controllers & Routes:** Build the complete logic in `auth.controller.js` for `register`, `login`, `logout` (which invalidates the refresh token), and `refreshAccessToken`.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **State Management:** Implement `store/slices/authSlice.js` using Redux Toolkit to manage user data, authentication status (`isAuthenticated`), loading states, and errors.
    2.  **Professional Forms:** Use the **React Hook Form** library combined with the Zod schemas for seamless client-side and server-side validation on the `LoginPage` and `RegisterPage`. This provides instant, user-friendly feedback.
    3.  **Token Handling:** Securely manage the access token in memory within the Redux store. The `apiClient` will automatically handle refreshing the token using the refresh token cookie when a 401 error is detected on a request.
    4.  **Protected Routing:** Create a `<ProtectedRoute>` component that checks the `isAuthenticated` state from the Redux store and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** Users can register, log in, and log out. The system provides persistent sessions using secure refresh tokens. Protected routes are fully functional and inaccessible to unauthorized users.

---

### **Phase 2: The Professional Ecosystem (Companies & Profiles)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To build out the core entities of the platform: comprehensive, editable user profiles and dedicated company pages.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** A professional network is only as valuable as the richness of its profiles. We need to provide users and companies with the tools to represent themselves professionally, which in turn creates a high-value ecosystem for recruiters and job seekers.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Models:** Finalize the `user.model.js` (adding headline, bio, social links) and create the `company.model.js` (company name, logo URL, website, size, industry, description).
    2.  **Image Uploads:** Integrate `multer` for handling file uploads. Create a service that processes and uploads images to a cloud storage provider like **Cloudinary** or **AWS S3**, storing only the URL in the database.
    3.  **CRUD APIs:** Implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for both User profiles and Company profiles.
    4.  **Ownership Middleware:** Implement `middlewares/ownership.middleware.js`. This middleware will be used on `PUT` and `DELETE` routes to verify that the ID of the logged-in user matches the `authorId` on the document they are trying to modify.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Pages:** Build the `ProfilePage.jsx`, `CompanyProfilePage.jsx`, and a multi-tabbed `SettingsPage.jsx` (e.g., Edit Profile, Account Settings).
    2.  **Forms:** Create dedicated forms for editing user profiles and creating/editing company profiles, including a user-friendly image upload component with a preview feature.
    3.  **UI/UX:** Design a clean, professional layout for displaying profile and company information, clearly separating different sections like "About," "Skills," and "Activity."

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** Users can create and edit their detailed personal profiles. Verified users can create and manage dedicated pages for their companies. All profiles support image uploads for logos and profile pictures.

---

### **Phase 3: The Content Engine (Job Postings)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To create a seamless, intuitive, and robust workflow for posting, viewing, filtering, and managing jobs.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** The core function of the platform is connecting talent with opportunities. A clunky job posting or search experience will deter both recruiters and applicants. We'll focus on creating a best-in-class user flow.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Model:** Implement the `job.model.js` with all fields, including enums for `jobType` and `location` to ensure data consistency.
    2.  **Advanced Search API:** Implement a powerful search and filtering logic for the `GET /api/v1/jobs` endpoint. It should support filtering by multiple skills (AND/OR logic), location, job type, and a full-text search on the title and description.
    3.  **CRUD & Ownership:** Implement the full CRUD API for jobs, ensuring the `ownership.middleware.js` protects all edit and delete operations.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Multi-Step Form:** Build the `CreateJobPage.jsx` as a multi-step wizard (e.g., Step 1: Job Details, Step 2: Skills & Qualifications, Step 3: Preview & Publish). This breaks down a large form and improves completion rates.
    2.  **Powerful Filtering UI:** On the `JobsListPage.jsx`, create an advanced search bar and filter sidebar with multi-select dropdowns and checkboxes.
    3.  **State Management for Filters:** Use the Redux store or URL query parameters to manage the state of the filters, allowing users to share links to their filtered job searches.
    4.  **Job Detail View:** Design a clean and scannable `JobDetailPage.jsx` that highlights key information and provides a clear call-to-action to apply.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** Recruiters can post, edit, and manage jobs through a user-friendly interface. Job seekers can effectively search, filter, and view detailed job listings.

---

### **Phase 4: Web3 Trust Layer (Secure Payment Verification)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To implement a highly secure, auditable, and user-friendly on-chain payment flow that serves as the platform's trust-building gatekeeper.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** This is a core differentiator and a major technical showcase. The process must be both cryptographically secure and easy for a non-technical user to understand. We are not just verifying a payment; we are demonstrating the practical application of blockchain for creating trusted systems.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Service Implementation:** In `services/blockchain.service.js`, using **Ethers.js**, implement a `verifyPayment` function that performs a rigorous, multi-point check:
        * Fetch the transaction receipt using the hash. Confirm `receipt.status === 1`.
        * Verify `receipt.from.toLowerCase() === user.walletAddress.toLowerCase()`.
        * Verify `receipt.to.toLowerCase() === process.env.ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS.toLowerCase()`.
        * Fetch the full transaction details and verify `tx.value` matches the exact fee required.
        * Check that `receipt.confirmations` is above a safe threshold (e.g., > 6) to protect against blockchain reorganizations.
    2.  **Audit Logging:** Create a `transactions.model.js`. Before starting verification, create a record with `status: 'pending'`. Update it to `'success'` or `'failed'` with an error reason upon completion. This creates an auditable trail.
    3.  **Controller Logic:** The `payment.controller.js` orchestrates this flow: call the service, wait for the result, and only if successful, update the corresponding job's `isLive` status to `true`.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Web3 Library:** Flesh out `lib/web3.js` with robust error handling for all Ethers.js interactions.
    2.  **Informative Payment Modal:** The `PaymentModal.jsx` must clearly display the required fee, the destination address (with a copy button), and a warning to the user to double-check the details in their MetaMask wallet.
    3.  **Clear UI States:** The UI must guide the user through every step: "Awaiting your confirmation in MetaMask...", "Processing transaction on the blockchain (this may take a moment)...", "Verifying payment with our server...", "Success! Your job is now live."
    4.  **Transparency:** Upon success, provide the user with a direct link to the transaction on a block explorer like AmoyScan, reinforcing trust.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The payment flow is cryptographically secure, resilient to common issues, and provides a transparent, confidence-inspiring experience for the user.

---

### **Phase 5: The Intelligence Layer (Asynchronous AI)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To integrate powerful AI features in a way that enhances the user experience without ever slowing down the application, demonstrating advanced architectural thinking.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** AI processing, especially for large documents like resumes, can be slow. A professional application should never make a user wait for a background task. By processing asynchronously, we make the app feel instantaneous and robust.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Job Queue Setup:** Integrate **BullMQ** and set up a connection to a **Redis** server. Define a specific queue for AI tasks (e.g., `'ai-processing'`).
    2.  **Job Enqueueing:** Modify the `ai.controller.js`. When a request for skill extraction from a large bio or resume comes in, it will **not** call the AI service directly. Instead, it will add a job to the BullMQ queue with the necessary data (e.g., `{ userId, textToProcess }`) and immediately return a `202 Accepted` status to the client.
    3.  **Dedicated Worker Process:** Create a separate Node.js worker file (`ai.worker.js`). This process listens exclusively to the `'ai-processing'` queue. When a job is received, it calls the `ai.service.js` (which contains the Gemini API logic).
    4.  **Database Update:** Upon successful completion of the AI task, the worker process directly updates the user's profile in the MongoDB database with the extracted skills. It will also create an in-app notification (for Phase 7).
    5.  **Real-time Matching:** The job match score, which needs to be real-time, will remain a synchronous API call as it's expected to be fast.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **UI Feedback:** After a user clicks "Auto-extract Skills", the UI should immediately show a persistent "Processing your profile..." state.
    2.  **Real-time Updates:** To notify the user of completion, we will leverage the WebSocket system from the next phase. When the backend worker finishes, it will emit a `profile_updated` event. The frontend will listen for this event and automatically refresh the user's profile data and remove the "Processing" message. This is superior to polling.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** AI features are seamlessly integrated. Long-running AI tasks are offloaded to a background process, ensuring the user interface remains fast and responsive at all times.

---

### **Phase 6: The Community Fabric (Real-time Interaction)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To transform the platform from a static board into a living, breathing, interactive community using real-time technologies.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** Real-time feedback makes an application feel alive and modern. Seeing likes, comments, and notifications appear instantly without refreshing the page is a key driver of user engagement and retention.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **WebSocket Integration:** Integrate **Socket.IO** with the Express server.
    2.  **Authenticated Sockets:** Implement middleware for Socket.IO that authenticates the connection using the user's JWT, ensuring only valid users can connect.
    3.  **Room Management:** Upon a successful connection, have each user's socket `join` a room named after their `userId`. This allows for targeted, private messaging.
    4.  **Event Emitters:** In your controllers (e.g., after a new comment is saved), emit a WebSocket event to the relevant user's room (e.g., `io.to(postAuthorId).emit('new_comment', newCommentData)`).
    5.  **CRUD APIs:** Implement the full backend logic for posts, comments, and likes.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Socket Client:** Set up a Socket.IO client that establishes a connection when a user logs in.
    2.  **Event Listeners:** Create listeners for all relevant server events (`new_notification`, `new_comment`, `like_update`, etc.).
    3.  **Real-time UI Updates:** When an event is received, use the data to update the application's state in Redux directly. This will cause the relevant components to re-render in real-time (e.g., a like counter increments, a new comment appears at the bottom of a post).
    4.  **UI Implementation:** Build the full UI for the social feed, post creation, and nested comment threads.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** Users receive instant feedback and updates for social interactions, making the platform feel dynamic, modern, and highly engaging.

---

### **Phase 7: The Engagement Loop (Notifications & Email)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To proactively re-engage users and pull them back to the platform by informing them of important and relevant activity.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** Even the best platform is useless if users forget about it. A strategic notification system (both in-app and via email) is a powerful growth lever that drives repeat visits and keeps users invested in the ecosystem.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Model:** Implement the `notification.model.js` with fields for `recipient`, `sender`, `type`, `link` (to the relevant content), and `isRead`.
    2.  **Notification Service:** Create a centralized `notification.service.js`. Whenever a key event happens (new follower, job application status change), other services will call this service to create a notification document in the database and emit the real-time WebSocket event.
    3.  **Email Integration:** Implement `email.service.js` using a reliable transactional email provider like **SendGrid**. Create beautiful HTML email templates for different notification types.
    4.  **Email Queue:** For non-urgent emails (e.g., a weekly digest of recommended jobs), add them to a separate BullMQ queue to be processed in batches, preventing email server overload.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Notifications UI:** Create a `NotificationsPage.jsx` that fetches and displays a user's notification history, grouped by date.
    2.  **Notification Bell:** Implement a notification bell component in the `Navbar` that shows a real-time count of unread notifications (updated via WebSockets). Clicking it opens a dropdown with the latest notifications.
    3.  **User Preferences:** Build a `SettingsNotifications.jsx` page where users have granular control over which in-app and email notifications they wish to receive. This is crucial for user trust.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The platform can communicate effectively with users through multiple channels, maximizing engagement and providing timely, valuable information.

---

### **Phase 8: The Control Center (Admin & Moderation)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To build the essential internal tools required to manage, monitor, and ensure the safety and integrity of the platform and its community.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** A public platform without administrative tools is a ship without a captain. Building an admin dashboard demonstrates an understanding of real-world operational needs, from user support to content moderation and business intelligence.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement robust RBAC. The `auth.middleware.js` can be extended to check for specific roles (e.g., `isAdmin`, `isModerator`).
    2.  **Secure Admin API:** Build a separate set of `admin.routes.js` that are protected by the admin-role middleware. These endpoints will allow for actions like viewing site-wide statistics, searching for any user, disabling a user account, or deleting any job/post.
    3.  **Data Aggregation:** Create special API endpoints that perform database aggregations to provide data for the dashboard charts (e.g., new users per day, jobs posted per category).

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Admin Section:** Create a completely separate section of the app (e.g., at the `/admin` route), potentially with its own layout, protected by a frontend role check.
    2.  **Dashboard UI:** Build a dashboard homepage that displays key metrics using charts and graphs (using a library like **Recharts**).
    3.  **Management Tables:** Create powerful data tables (using a library like **TanStack Table**) for viewing, searching, and managing users, jobs, and companies, complete with actions like "Disable User" or "Delete Post".

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** Platform administrators have a secure and powerful interface to maintain the health, safety, and integrity of the community and its content.

---

### **Phase 9: The Quality Gateway (Comprehensive Testing)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To build a comprehensive, automated testing suite that ensures the application is reliable, bug-free, and maintainable for the long term.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** Shipping fast is important, but shipping with confidence is professional. A robust testing strategy is not a feature; it's an insurance policy. It allows the team to add new features and refactor existing code without fear of breaking something else.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Unit Tests:** Use **Jest** to test all critical business logic in services and utility functions in complete isolation. Use Jest's mocking capabilities to fake dependencies like database calls or external APIs.
    2.  **Integration Tests:** Use **Jest** and **Supertest** to test the API layer. For these tests, connect to a separate, dedicated test database (or an in-memory MongoDB server) to ensure tests are isolated and repeatable. Test the full request-response cycle, including middleware.
* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Unit Tests:** Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to test individual utility functions, custom hooks, and simple, presentational components.
    2.  **Integration / Component Tests:** Test more complex organisms that involve user interaction and state changes. For example, test that filling out the login form and clicking "Submit" correctly calls the API function with the right data.
    3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use **Cypress** to automate critical, multi-page user flows in a real browser. A key E2E test would be: `User registers -> logs in -> creates a company -> posts a job -> goes through the payment flow -> logs out -> logs back in and verifies the job is live`.
    4.  **CI Integration:** Configure the GitHub Actions pipeline to run the entire test suite on every pull request. Block any merges if tests fail.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The application has a high degree of automated test coverage, providing a strong safety net and enabling confident, continuous development.

---

### **Phase 10: Launch Readiness & Deployment (Go-Live)**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To prepare and deploy the application to a production environment securely, performantly, and with a zero-downtime strategy.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** Deployment is a critical product milestone. A botched launch can ruin a first impression. This phase is about ensuring the application is not just functional but also fast, secure, and observable in a live environment.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Production Logging:** Configure the Winston logger to output structured JSON to a file in production and integrate an error monitoring service like **Sentry** to capture and alert on any unhandled exceptions.
    2.  **Build & Containerization:** Create a production build script. For maximum portability and scalability, containerize the backend application using **Docker**.
    3.  **Deployment:** Deploy the containerized application to **Render**. Configure all production environment variables securely. Set up auto-deploys from the `main` branch and configure health check endpoints that Render can use to ensure zero-downtime deployments.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Performance Optimization:** Use Vite's build analysis tools to inspect the final bundle. Implement route-based code splitting using `React.lazy()` to ensure the initial page load is as fast as possible.
    2.  **Asset Optimization:** Ensure all images are compressed and served in modern formats (like WebP).
    3.  **Deployment:** Deploy the static frontend to **Vercel**, connecting it to the GitHub repo. Configure the production backend API URL as an environment variable.
    4.  **DNS & SSL:** Configure custom domains for both the frontend and backend services and ensure HTTPS is enforced everywhere.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The application is live on the internet, accessible via a custom domain, fully secure with SSL, monitored for errors, and configured for continuous, zero-downtime deployments.

---

### **Phase 11: Growth & Monetization Engine**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To implement the tools and features required to execute the Go-To-Market strategy, grow the user base, and generate revenue.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** A product is not a business until it has a path to growth and revenue. This phase demonstrates the ability to think beyond the technology and focus on the commercial viability and user acquisition strategy outlined in the project brief.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Subscription Logic:** Integrate a payment processor like **Stripe** to handle recurring subscription billing.
    2.  **Premium Gating:** Create a middleware that checks a user's subscription status. In the API, gate certain features or increase rate limits for premium users (e.g., "Pro" recruiters can view more candidate profiles per day).
    3.  **Referral System:** Build the backend logic for a user referral system to drive viral growth.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Product Analytics:** Integrate a tool like **PostHog** or **Mixpanel**. Add event tracking to all key user actions (sign up, post job, apply, etc.) to build funnels and understand user behavior.
    2.  **Pricing & Checkout:** Build a professional pricing page detailing the different subscription tiers. Implement a secure checkout flow using Stripe Elements.
    3.  **Upgrade Prompts:** Strategically place UI elements throughout the app prompting free users to upgrade to unlock premium features.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The platform has a functional monetization system and the analytical tools needed to measure, understand, and optimize user growth.

---

### **Phase 12: Scaling & Future Horizons**

* **üéØ Primary Objective:** To plan for and address the challenges of long-term growth, performance at scale, and the continued evolution of the product.

* **üß† Product Thinking & Rationale:** A successful product is a living entity that must evolve. This final phase demonstrates strategic foresight and an understanding of the full application lifecycle, from initial build to long-term maintenance and innovation.

* **üõ†Ô∏è Backend Tasks:**
    1.  **Performance Auditing:** Use tools like MongoDB's query profiler to identify and optimize slow database queries by adding appropriate indexes.
    2.  **Caching Strategy:** Implement a caching layer using **Redis** to store the results of expensive queries or frequently accessed data (e.g., a popular user's profile), dramatically reducing database load.
    3.  **Scaling Plan Documentation:** Create a document outlining the strategy for future scaling. This would include plans for horizontal scaling (load balancing across multiple server instances) and potentially breaking out a core, high-traffic service (like the notification service) into its own microservice.

* **üíª Frontend Tasks:**
    1.  **Performance Audit:** Use Google Lighthouse and browser dev tools to audit and improve core web vitals (LCP, INP, CLS).
    2.  **Component Library Documentation:** Use **Storybook** to create a living document of the React component library. This makes it easier for the team to discover and reuse existing components, increasing development velocity.
    3.  **Public Roadmap:** Create a public-facing page or use a tool to share the product roadmap. This builds community, gathers valuable user feedback on upcoming features, and shows that the project has a long-term vision. This roadmap would include future "epic" features like a dedicated mobile app or trustless on-chain job escrows via smart contracts.

* **‚úÖ Definition of Done:** The platform is optimized for its current load and has a clear, documented plan for future technical and product evolution, ensuring its long-term viability and success.
